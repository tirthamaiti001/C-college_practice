# C Programming Codebase (First Year College)

This repository contains all the source code, assignments, and lab exercises completed during my introductory C programming course in the first year of my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with Data Science at Haldia Institute of Technology.

It serves as a comprehensive log of my foundational learning in structured programming principles.

## All the codes are organized into clear directories based on the lab sessions.
